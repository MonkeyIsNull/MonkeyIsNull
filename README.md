## Hey all

Hey, I'm Adam. Somehow I've been working in this field for 28 years.
At the moment I've been working on some [RDAP](https://github.com/icann/icann-rdap/) [projects](https://github.com/icann/rdap-conformance-tool) and a little bit of DNSSEC.


My current tech-interests are all about speed in Low-Level Networking & VirtualMachines. How we can we better track packets and get the necessary information out of them in a manner as fast as freaking possible? Hence some of my current projects below:

  - [RistrettoDB](https://github.com/MonkeyIsNull/RistrettoDB) - 4.6M rows/sec embedded database
  - [VFM](https://github.com/MonkeyIsNull/velocity-filter-machine) - Packet filtering VM
  - [PacketVelocity](https://github.com/MonkeyIsNull/PacketVelocity) - High-Speed Cross-platform packet capture
  - [Cortado](https://github.com/MonkeyIsNull/cortado) - A caffeine infused version of Lisp written in Rust
  - [TinyTotVM](https://github.com/MonkeyIsNull/TinyTotVM) - Experimental Virtual Machine
